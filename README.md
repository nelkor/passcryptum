## Standalone offline version

Download `passcryptum.html` from
[the releases](https://github.com/nelkor/passcryptum/releases).
Open the file in a browser by double-clicking it.

## Getting started

- Create the only strong password which you will have to remember;
- Log in the Passcryptum with the help of this password;
- Add your account by the service name and login;
- Copy your password with the help of the button;
- Change the password in your account to the one that was generated by Passcryptum.

Well done! You have transferred one of your accounts to Passcryptum.
Every time you need to log in to this account, enter Passcryptum
with your origin password and copy the login password.

## Further use

Set the PIN! Read the
[instruction](https://github.com/nelkor/passcryptum/blob/main/docs/pin.md),
why it is important and how to use it.

Some services restrict our ability to use special characters in passwords.
For such services, you can uncheck "Use special characters".

Sometimes we need to update our account passwords. In order for the copy password button
to start issuing a new password for the old login, you need to increment its version.

You can download the list of your services as a file or text in order to transfer
them to another device. This list is always encrypted, and it will be impossible
to read what services you use without knowing your origin password.
